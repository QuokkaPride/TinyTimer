# TinyTimer

The tiniest, simplest, always-visible-on-screen Pomodoro timer designed for hyperfocus on Windows.

TinyTimer was designed me, Devon Saliga, to address my frustrations with traditional Pomodoro clocks: they are too large to raimain always visible on the screen, they are bloated with features, have bad UI, and they fail to encourage movement between work sessions. TinyTimer addresses these issues while sparking joy.

## Known Defects (As of 24.01.17):

1. **Occasionally hides behind the Windows taskbar**
   - Suggested Fix: Increase refresh timing or reposition the timer to avoid overlap with the taskbar.

2. **SLOTH TIME shifts above the taskbar if "Start Time" is not clicked**
   - Suggested Fix: Address positioning logic to prevent this behavior during idle states.

3. **Multiple instances can be opened simultaneously**
   - Suggested Fix: Add functionality to restrict launching duplicate instances.

4. **TinyTimer icon not showing**

5. **Blocked by Windows Defender**
